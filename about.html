        <h3>About myself page</h3>
        <p><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name in arabic <span style="font-family: 'Aref Ruqaa', serif;">غـــــاروت فوضيل</span>, from Algeria i'm 30 years old maried and have a kid Iyad (<span style="font-family: 'Aref Ruqaa', serif;">إيــــــاد</span>) Master in Computer Science, obtained this degree in 2012 from the University of Ibn Khaldun located in the city of Tiaret (central western Algeria). I chose this field of study about love and conviction. From a young age, I was fond of electronic devices, computers and all computers. When I got my baccalaureate in civil engineering because there is no baccalaureate in computer science in Algeria, I decided to specialize in the field I always wanted.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After graduation I worked in professional formation center as training teacher in conjunction with the master's degree from 2010 until 2014 partial time and then when I got the final certificate I was able to plaque a job in the Directorate of Local Administration as a state engineer in informatics, I stayed in that job only two months where I got another job in State financial control in April 2013.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After some time I found that my work in the same profession is a bit boring so I decided to go to a more dynamic and more open and sophisticated profession so I chose the profession of web developer and I had some experience in the programming language PHP so I used that experience in creating and developing some small programs and it was a fairly practical. Then I found that I had to develop my skills more and I participated in some training online and in different platforms and many sites including CodinGame, Stack Overflow, freeCodeCamp, SoloLearn, Udacity, and finally edX platform in this course.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, I always feel that I still need to develop my skills further and arrange my ideas through methods and methods that I have to master and so I chose this course.</p>
